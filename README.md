# Forge Boilerplate
 This is a project I did during my time in Arcadis. This is a fork from a private repo of Philippe L. and adapted for a number of internat projects. The project requires a mongodb connection with projects translated to be used with it. There a number of posts on stack overflow from Salazar Riva - an acronym I used at the time for more information.
